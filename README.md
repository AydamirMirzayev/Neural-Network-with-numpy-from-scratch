# Neural-Network-with-numpy-from-scratch
Description: From scratch implementation of a single hidden layer neural network and perception for fitting continuous function

Dataset: A somewhat continuous, somewhat classical regression dataset with a single input and output value

Neural Network: Neural network contains a single hidden layer. Number of hidden units can be adjusted through parameters. Activation function is a  sigmoid, and model is trained with batch gradient descent.
  NN:
    @description: Train a neural network
    @param: Number of epocs (epoc), Learning Rage (rate), Moment* (mmnt), Number of hidden units (hidden_no), Data (data)
    @return: Learning weights
  plot_NN_result:
    @description: plot result for the final fit
    @param: Input Wights (input_W_predicted, inner_W_predicted), Data (data), Title (title) 

(work in progress)
