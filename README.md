# Neural-Network-with-numpy-from-scratch
Description: From scratch implementation of a single hidden layer neural network and perception for fitting continuous function

Dataset: A somewhat continuous, somewhat classical regression dataset with a single input and output value

Neural Network: Neural network contains a single hidden layer. Number of hidden units can be adjusted through parameters. Activation function is a  sigmoid, and model is trained with batch gradient descent.

Percetron: Single input single output perceptron with an identity activation funtion

Loss function: MSE

Repo contains both a notebook and .py files
